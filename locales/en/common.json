Since then, I’ve focused on the front end: I’ve built products with React and Next.js for organizations like Zurich, MetLife, and the Government of Guadalajara, along with consulting projects (for example, a retail audit platform and real-time dashboards with ECharts). To round things out, I completed a nine-month Data Science program at TripleTen (Python, SQL, EDA, and ML), which helps me make data-informed decisions on every project.",
